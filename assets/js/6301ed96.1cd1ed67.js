Google Maps follows this principle by first providing an overview of the surrounding area, then allows users to filter restaurants, gyms, schools, etc., or zoom in on specific regions. Lastly, if a user decides to click on a location of interest, Google Maps provides them with more specific information on that location including its website, reviews, and address.
