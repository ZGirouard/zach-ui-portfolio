I created a simple mockup of the app in Figma, and then experimented with three alternative colorways to analyze what different emotions and feelings the app gives off. \\r\\n\\r\\n![Green Hulu](GreenHulu.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first user interface here shows the original Hulu screen with it\'s bright green logo and dark green/teal background. This is a fairly analogous color scheme with all the colors falling pretty close to each other on the color wheel. When designing this interface, I believe the designers wanted to give the user a sense of calmness as they sat down to watch their favorite movie or tv show. At the same time, the green palate gives off a sense of freshness as new shows continue to populate the app each week. Overall, I think it\'s a very pleasing design, and does a good job of balancing feelings of excitement with feelings of tranquility.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Orange Hulu](OrangeHulu.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second interface here is the first redesign I did and shows a bright orange Hulu logo overlayed on top of a burnt orange/brown backdrop. This, as with the following two examples, also follows an analogous color scheme as I wanted to keep the general idea Hulu was going for, while still experimenting with different colors. Overall I have mixed feelings about this color scheme. On one hand, I don\'t mind the brown background, and I think it also helps establish a sense of calmness in the user. On the other hand, the brown seems too safe for a tech and entertainment company who is constantly releasing new features and shows. I think if the shows were more geared towards relaxing content this wouldn\'t be a bad color scheme, but with the variety of shows Hulu has, I just don\'t think it works well.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Red Hulu](RedHulu.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nMy second redesign shows a bright red Hulu logo on top of a maroon/burgundy background. This is one design that I actually really like. I think the red gives a sense of warmth, guiding the user to cozy up for a night of entertainment. At the same time, it has a sense of passion or desire behind it that\'s perfect for couples looking to watch a movie for their date night. I also feel like the red is dulled enough so as to not spur any feelings of aggression or fear in the user. The only problem I could see with this color scheme is it has striking similarities to one of Hulu\'s main competitors, Netflix, and by using the same color scheme, it would be a bit harder for Hulu to differentiate themself.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Blue Hulu](BlueHulu.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe last redesign here shows an electric blue Hulu logo complemented by a dark blue background. This is my favorite color scheme out of all the redesigns. The electric blue logo conveys the feeling that Hulu is cutting edge and constantly evolving, which is perfect for a tech company. At the same time, as the user gets further down into the page, they are greeted with this dark blue gradient that\'s almost akin to diving deeper into unknown waters. It\'s elicits a sense of mystery and intrigue, while still feeling calming and tranquil. Overall, I really enjoy this color scheme, and if Hulu one day decided to change their app to these colors, I\'d have no problem with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, I think Hulu\'s designers did a very good job choosing the color scheme for their application. It conveys calmness while still feeling fresh. However, I think the most effective design would have to be the blue colorway. When a user is scrolling through an entertainment app like Hulu, they are either staying on the surface and watching a familiar favorite, or they venture down to explore what else the app has to offer. I think the blue colorway is a perfect visual representation of this journey. At the same time, the electric blue logo conveys that the app, and company are forever evolving and on the cutting edge of the latest technology."},{"id":"/Colors1","metadata":{"permalink":"/zach-ui-portfolio/blog/Colors1","source":"@site/blog/Colors_1.md","title":"Reading - Colors I","description":"One thing that I found interesting in this section was when the book talked about after-images.

For example, red is seen as aggressive, bold, and sensual whereas blue can be calm, open, and confident. I think this is something that I\'ve picked up on throughout my life, but this is the first time I\'ve seen it put into words. If I had to choose one word to describe this phenomenon, I would call it aura. Aura is the attitudes, feelings, and mental models we conjure up when we look at a certain color. Seeing a home filled with green plants reminds of the calmness and tranquility of nature. A person dressed in all yellow we might see as vibrant and outgoing. It\'s these auras surrounding colors that affect our everyday attitudes towards certain people, places, and things. I think this concept is important in my career as well because when I go and design logos, branding, and websites, I have to take a second to think about the aura or vibe of the company, and try to represent that in what I create.

Some of the most important ideas he goes over in this chapter are the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the use of negative space, and the rule of thirds. First off, the signal-to-noise ratio is a measurement of how much relevant vs. irrelevant information there is on a page, with the goal being to have the highest ratio possible. In order to evaluate this principle, I\'m using a snapshot of Red Bull\'s website homepage. On this page, you can see that there isn\'t a lot of irrelevant or overwhelming information. Even the design elements are kept pretty minimal to ensure the user isn\'t bombarded with information when they enter the site. Another principle Reynolds talked about was the use of negative space. This principles explains that it\'s important to have space on a design that isn\'t filled with elements. This helps make the design feel less underwhelming and gives the user\'s eye a chance to rest. On the Red Bull website, there is quite a bit of negative space surrounding the main graphic. Additionally, the section under it contains a similar amount of negative space. This helps make the design feel more cohesive and professional. The final principles that Reynolds talked about was the rule of thirds. This is a principle borrowed from photography and it explains that humans find designs to be the most visually appealing when important subjects or pieces of information are placed along a one-third grid. On the Red Bull website, it looks as if the information for the featured drink is placed about one-third of the way onto the site. However, it also seems like the graphic for the can is directly centered. I think it would be interesting to place the can along one of the one-third lines and see how the design looks.

Name, background, current occupation, time in the occupation, awareness of tech, etc. (only info that\'s relevant to your task)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nName: Ben Roter\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBackground: Ben is a 21-year-old skateboard enthusiast who started skating as a teen. He\u2019s built some skateboards in the past, either in skate shops or online, but is always looking to improve his setup. He currently works as part of a digital marketing agency, designing graphics and creating campaigns. As a result, he has some experience with graphic design, and works on his own art in his free time. He has experience working with a host of different design and web technologies. He has worked as a digital marketer for the past 2 years, and has a keen eye for detail. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are their responsibilities, values, and/or personal goals?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nComing from a design background, Ben holds creativity in high esteem. He keeps note of things he finds interesting or unique. He likes to stay up to date with the current technologies and design trends coming out. As a marketer, Ben values efficiency. Part of his job is getting things done in the best way possible, and he appreciates when others value that. He\u2019s very good at managing multiple different tasks at the same time, and frequently interacts with a diverse range of people. He hopes to create a skateboard that he can ride to work in the mornings, or can practice on at the local skatepark. He wants his board to be unique to him, and express his creativity and personal style. Additionally, he hopes that he can create the board without having to learn another design tool.\\r\\nStory brainstorming:\\r\\nThe ultimate goal: Why do users need to interact with your UI?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\tUsers need to interact with my UI in order to create a custom skateboard. They will have the ability to easily choose certain colors, designs, etc. which will give them a truly unique and rewarding experience for creating their board.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBrainstorm 15 possible scenarios (remember, quantity and novelty are more important than feasibility). Include all 15 in your document. (You could include a snapshot of a notebook, post-its, etc., since you\'ll be brainstorming by hand!)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nColor Mixer - User is able to interact with a custom color mixer tool that will allow them to have solid colors or gradients on their deck\\r\\nDesign Tool - Users will be able to draw, create shapes, write text, make lines, etc. on their board which allows them to create a custom design\\r\\n AR Visualizer - Users will have the ability to see what their design would look like in real life using an AR Visualizer tool\\r\\nCommunity Designs - Users will have the ability to submit/copy designs to/from a community showcase that can be seen by all users on the platform\\r\\nBudget Tool - Users will have access to a budget tool allowing them to create budget friendly designs and compare the prices of different items\\r\\nCompatibility Tool - As users select different products for their custom board, the UI will update letting users know what other products are compatible with their current build. Users can also compare two items to see if they are compatible.\\r\\nDesign Guide - Users will have the option to follow a step-by-step design guide that will take them through the process of creating their first board. Almost like a tutorial.\\r\\nPhoto Upload - Users will have the option to upload personal photos that can be placed on their board.\\r\\n3D Model - As users design their board, they will have a 3D Model preview of their board that updates in real time.\\r\\nFavorite Builds - Users will have the capability to favorite boards and board designs so that they can use them in the future.\\r\\nCustomizable Deck Shapes - Users will have the ability to create custom deck shapes based on their needs.\\r\\nDeck Sizing Guide - Users will have access to a deck sizing guide that allows them to input their height and weight and receive deck size recommendations.\\r\\nMatching Clothing Bundle - Users will have the ability to transfer their design to select clothing items and receive a bundle that includes the clothing and their deck.\\r\\nDesign Contests - Users can participate in design contests and win rewards. The best designs will be featured in a showcase and be able to be used by other users.\\r\\nCollaborative Design - Users will be able to collaborate in real time with others who they invite to a session. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPick your most compelling story.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDesign Tool - Users will be able to draw, create shapes, write text, make lines, etc. on their board which allows them to create a custom design\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine some details. Outline them in your document.\\r\\nWhere is the user when they are interacting with their UI? Are there any constraints in this space that need to be noted? (Is the space small? Is the character in front of customers, investors, or children? Is the room dark? etc.) Why might the space be relevant for users of your interface?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAs an e-commerce/design site, users are most likely to be at their place of residence while interacting with the UI. The most common constraint for at-home customers would be other distractions that cause them to step away from the UI. For this reason, it\u2019s important that designs are automatically saved. We can assume users will have access to a stable network connection. Consumers are most likely to be in a variety of lighting situations depending on their home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen is the user interacting with your UI? Is the character in a hurry? Are they hungry? Are they getting ready for bed? Why is the timing relevant to a user interacting with your interface?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe user is most likely interacting with our UI when they have some free time. They are most likely not in a rush, or in need of anything quickly. For this reason, I suspect users will most likely use the product in the evening, at night, or on the weekends. I suspect that if the user is trying to make a custom design, they would want to take their time. This is important because we want to still give the user a relatively quick process, but it\u2019s not necessarily the most important thing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, it\'s time to introduce a plot. \\r\\nHow is the user going to interact with your UI? How are they going to access your UI?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tThe user will interact with our UI using a web interface. If I choose to include it in AR mode, it means that a mobile feature will most likely need to be added to accommodate this. They will access our UI either through a marketing link/ad, or through an organic Google search. Before having full access to all UI features, they will first need to create an account on the site.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow do they navigate through the UI (You may not have all of these details yet, so you can keep it general.)?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe user will first navigate through a simple UI prompting them to create an account. Users will be allowed to check out as a guest, but will not have access to creating custom designs without an account. From there, users will either have access to prebuilt boards, the custom design tool, build your own board, or individual components. Prebuilt boards and individual components will be similar to traditional e-commerce websites. The custom design tool will have a similar layout to Adobe Illustrator, and allow users to customize their own board. The build your own board page will take users through a step-by-step process of choosing all the components they need for a custom board. In this process, users will have a 3D render of the board as they choose to build it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are they thinking as they interact with it?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than anything, the user is most likely thinking of whatever design idea they have in mind for their board. This might not be concrete yet, but it\u2019s important that the UI allows for simple tasks to be as easy as possible, while still helping the user achieve this vision.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow will they know they\'ve been successful in completing their tasks? Answer these questions and any others that are relevant in your design doc.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUsers will know they\u2019ve been successful in creating a custom design as it will save the design to their account. When building their own board, users will see components be replaced on a 3D render and also listed somewhere. They will know they are done building a board when the interface prompts them to add their skateboard to the cart. For simple tasks, notification banners will let users know whether their actions were successful. \\r\\n\\t\\r\\nBring it all together: Write a story (~300-600 words) incorporating all the details you outlined above. Be effortful and intentional when writing your story. This story will motivate everything you do for this project henceforth. The pages you design will be those motivated by this story. The task you provide your user test participants will be the task motivated by this story. This story will appear verbatim (with some possible editing) in your final project narrative on your portfolio. This story is the foundation for your project, so make sure it is stable (or at least approaching stability). \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUser Story: Ben\u2019s Custom Board\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tBen Roter is a 21-year-old skateboard enthusiast with a background in digital marketing and design. After breaking his old board at the skate park last weekend, Ben is looking to build a new skateboard that reflects his personality and creative flare. His friend recommended he try a new website that allows users to customize their own skateboard decks. After a long day of work, Ben settles onto his couch and opens his laptop, excited to try this new website. Ben is looking to design a skateboard that he can ride to work in the mornings, but also at the skatepark when he has time. \\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tBen\u2019s home is well-lit, with quick internet speeds. He occasionally has to get up during his web session to do various chores, or answer calls from family and friends. Upon opening the website, Ben is greeted with a well-designed page prompting him to either sign in, create an account, or continue as a guest. Since he\u2019s not sure whether he needs an account, Ben decides to continue as a guest. From there, Ben is taken to a stunning homepage featuring popular user designs, different skate parts, and a comprehensive navigation bar. In the navigation bar, Ben sees labels for: \u201cSkateboard Parts\u201d, \u201cPre Built Skateboards\u201d, \u201cDesign Your Own Deck\u201d, \u201cBuild a Custom Skateboard\u201d, and \u201cCommunity Designs\u201d. Ben is intrigued by the \u201cDesign Your Own Deck\u201d option, and hovers over the text, revealing a dropdown navigation with more options under each main navigation item. Still interested in designing his own deck, Ben clicks on the navigation item. He is taken to a page with a grayed out background and a notification prompting him that he must create an account to design his own deck with a small button to sign in or create an account. Ben then clicks the button and signs up using his personal email. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter navigating back to the page, Ben sees that there is a blank skateboard in the center with tools on the top and side containing different icons. Being in a design field, Ben recognizes most of the icons as allowing him to draw on the board, add shapes, or change the background color. For the icons he doesn\u2019t know, Ben hovers over them and is prompted with a description of what the tool does. Ben spends some time designing a board, and when he\u2019s done, he saves it to his account. After saving to his account, he gets a call and closes the site, returning about 30 minutes later.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Ben returns to the site, he navigates over to the \u201cBuild a Custom Skateboard\u201d tab. He is then taken to a page where he can select a deck for his skateboard. There is a tab for the normal designs, and one for custom user designs. Ben selects his design and hits continue. After he hits this button, a 3D render appears with his deck design on it. Additionally, a progress bar appears at the top of the screen. Ben goes through, selecting the proper wheels, bearings, and trucks for his deck. When a type of component is not compatible with his current build, it is given a faint red overlay. Eventually, Ben finishes designing his skateboard, and chooses \u201cAdd to Cart\u201d. From there, he follows a standard checkout interface, and after placing the order is sent a tracking number and a receipt for his purchase."},{"id":"/DesignRules","metadata":{"permalink":"/zach-ui-portfolio/blog/DesignRules","source":"@site/blog/Design_Rules.md","title":"Reading - Design Rules","description":"Word: Mindless","date":"2024-09-13T14:30:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"WordJournal","permalink":"/zach-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/wordjournal","description":"Choose a section of the reading and summarize it in a single word.

I think the word \\"mindless\\" typically has a negative connotation to it. This book argues, however, that keeping a webpage simple and mindless is they key to usability. It highlights the idea that users don\'t want to think as they navigate a website, it should be smooth sailing for them. Every time they encounter something unexpected, or that requires to much thinking, it turns them off from wanting to continue using the site. In order to enforce this principle, the author states that websites should have a clear hierarchy, good layout, and text that is as succinct as possible. This concept is important for me to remember in my career, because as a designer, I think it\'s common to think that your design is useable just because you yourself are able to use it. In order to become a great designer though, you have to really put yourself in someone else\'s shoes and see if your website is easy to use as someone with limited exposure."},{"id":"/SchneidermanInfoOrg","metadata":{"permalink":"/zach-ui-portfolio/blog/SchneidermanInfoOrg","source":"@site/blog/Schneiderman_Info_Org.md","title":"Reading - Schneiderman & Info Org","description":"I believe the Google Maps interface is an amazing example of what was described in the article. One of my biggest takeaways from the article was the idea of \\"Overview first, zoom and filter, then details-on-demand.\\" Google Maps follows this principle by first providing an overview of the surrounding area, then allows users to filter restaurants, gyms, schools, etc., or zoom in on specific regions. Lastly, if a user decides to click on a location of interest, Google Maps provides them with more specific information on that location including its website, reviews, and address. This interface would also be an example of 2-dimensional data since its essentially an interactive map. If you look at the recent searches, you can also see that Google Maps does a good job of keeping track of what I\'ve searched for in the past. In the article, this is termed \\"history\\". These principles are also used when mapping to a location as Google Maps will provide you with general directions first, and then allow you to customize your path based on your mode of transportation.

Signifiers can take the form of specific shapes, colors, or words that help give the user an idea as to what they can do with the product. For example, the eraser tip on the end of pencils is colored differently than the rest of the object. This gives a clue to users that the eraser of the pencil has a different function than the graphite end. The specific use of the eraser, however, comes from our conceptual model and cultural understanding. This is an important concept in my career because, as a UX Designer, I need to ensure that I include clear signifiers to let my users know that different parts of my product allow them different affordances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSource: Design of Everyday Things (https://dl.icdst.org/pdfs/files4/4bb8d08a9b309df7d86e62ec4056ceef.pdf), page 13\\r\\n\\r\\n![alt text](image-2.png)"},{"id":"/AffordancesSignifiers2","metadata":{"permalink":"/zach-ui-portfolio/blog/AffordancesSignifiers2","source":"@site/blog/Affordances_And_Signifiers_2.md","title":"Reading - Affordances & Signifiers II","description":"One concept that really stood out to me in this chapter was the idea of positive psychology as it relates to user experience and design. The book takes a different approach from what I\'ve been typically taught in school and encourages designers to push themselves outside the box and fail. Only by failing can designers learn from their mistakes. In contrast, I believe the traditional education system promotes the idea that students should stick to what they know and play it safe so they can receive a good grade. Furthermore, the book advises that designers should think positively for themselves and the people they interact with. I really enjoy this line of thinking as I think students and designers can get bogged down by the rules, budgeting, and logistics that come with creating a project which can lead to negative thought patterns. Instead, the book seems to argue for more of a \\"expect the best, plan for the worst\\" approach where designers should think positively about their users, but be forgiving of their mistakes. After all, as much as a designer wouldn\'t want to be punished for a design failure, a user wouldn\'t want to be punished for their mistake in using the design.
