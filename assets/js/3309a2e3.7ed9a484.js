Then, I worked primarily on the products and individual product pages, while they worked on the ancillary pages such as the checkout and profile pages.

In addition, I received a perfect grade on the project, which includes my presentation, our application functionality, and my contribution to the team."}),(0,h.jsx)("p",{children:" Looking back, there were a few things I think we could\u2019ve done better during the project. First, as a team, we had trouble connecting our frontend and backend elements until the very end of the project. We should\u2019ve made this a priority earlier on so we could\u2019ve done more testing with them connected. Individually, I wish I could\u2019ve spent more time designing the application logo, and I would\u2019ve rather used some software such as Adobe Photoshop to design it. Additionally, I think it would\u2019ve been beneficial to transfer my wireframe drawings into Figma before translating them into React Javascript. Unfortunately, due to the limited time constraints, and the fact that I was also a frontend developer for this project, I didn\u2019t have to do this. Now that I\u2019ve gained much more experience in Figma and Adobe Photoshop since this project, I think I could\u2019ve created a much higher fidelity prototype for this project. Lastly, I believe it would\u2019ve been beneficial to use JavaScript Bootstrap for our frontend to make it easier to develop the frontend, and give us more customization. Overall, I\u2019m proud of the work we did given the limited timeline and scope of the project. I learned a lot about working in a team to develop an application, and I\u2019d love to apply what I\u2019ve learned on another project."})]})}),(0,h.jsxs)("div",{style:{display:"flex",flexWrap:"wrap",padding:"20px",margin:"20px",marginBottom:"60px",justifyContent:"center"},children:[(0,h.jsx)("img",{src:d,alt:"Registration",style:{margin:"10px",transition:"transform 0.3s",width:"100%",maxWidth:"550px",borderRadius:"10px"}}),(0,h.jsx)("img",{src:i,alt:"Log In",style:{margin:"10px",transition:"transform 0.3s",width:"100%",maxWidth:"550px",borderRadius:"10px"}}),(0,h.jsx)("img",{src:s,alt:"Homescreen",style:{margin:"10px",transition:"transform 0.3s",width:"100%",maxWidth:"550px",borderRadius:"10px"}}),(0,h.jsx)("img",{src:a,alt:"Cart",style:{margin:"10px",transition:"transform 0.3s",width:"100%",maxWidth:"550px",borderRadius:"10px"}}),(0,h.jsx)("img",{src:n,alt:"Account",style:{margin:"10px",transition:"transform 0.3s",width:"100%",maxWidth:"550px",borderRadius:"10px"}}),(0,h.jsx)("img",{src:c,alt:"Shipping",style:{margin:"10px",transition:"transform 0.3s",width:"100%",maxWidth:"550px",borderRadius:"10px"}})]})]})}}}]);
