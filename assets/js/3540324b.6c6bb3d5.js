For example, red is seen as aggressive, bold, and sensual whereas blue can be calm, open, and confident. I think this is something that I've picked up on throughout my life, but this is the first time I've seen it put into words. If I had to choose one word to describe this phenomenon, I would call it aura. Aura is the attitudes, feelings, and mental models we conjure up when we look at a certain color. Seeing a home filled with green plants reminds of the calmness and tranquility of nature. A person dressed in all yellow we might see as vibrant and outgoing. It's these auras surrounding colors that affect our everyday attitudes towards certain people, places, and things. I think this concept is important in my career as well because when I go and design logos, branding, and websites, I have to take a second to think about the aura or vibe of the company, and try to represent that in what I create. Not to mention, I can use these ideas in my personal projects to ensure that I'm communicating the proper feelings to the audience."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,r.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,n.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,n.jsx)(u,{...e})}):u(e)}},8453:(e,t,o)=>{o.d(t,{R:()=>a,x:()=>i});var n=o(6540);const r={},s=n.createContext(r);function a(e){const t=n.useContext(s);return n.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}}),[t,e])}function i(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(r):e.components||r:a(e.components),n.createElement(s.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}}}]);
