Signifiers



Signifiers, as the author describes, are the clues designers include in their products to let users know what affordances are available to them. Signifiers can take the form of specific shapes, colors, or words that help give the user an idea as to what they can do with the product. For example, the eraser tip on the end of pencils is colored differently than the rest of the object. This gives a clue to users that the eraser of the pencil has a different function than the graphite end. The specific use of the eraser, however, comes from our conceptual model and cultural understanding. This is an important concept in my career because, as a UX Designer, I need to ensure that I include clear signifiers to let my users know that different parts of my product allow them different affordances.
