Word: Mindless

This word stuck out to the most when reading this section. I think the word "mindless" typically has a negative connotation to it. This book argues, however, that keeping a webpage simple and mindless is they key to usability. It highlights the idea that users don't want to think as they navigate a website, it should be smooth sailing for them. Every time they encounter something unexpected, or that requires to much thinking, it turns them off from wanting to continue using the site. In order to enforce this principle, the author states that websites should have a clear hierarchy, good layout, and text that is as succinct as possible. This concept is important for me to remember in my career, because as a designer, I think it's common to think that your design is useable just because you yourself are able to use it. In order to become a great designer though, you have to really put yourself in someone else's shoes and see if your website is easy to use as someone with limited exposure.
