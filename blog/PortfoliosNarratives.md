How to create a successful UX Portfolio:

1.  Homepage: Create a visually stunning homepage that fits the theme of your brand/projects. This could be through neon colors, a pastel color palette, interesting typography, etc. On the homepage, include your name, occupation, designer statement, links/thumbnails to case studies. and navigation. Make it easy for your user to see more of your portfolio.

2.  Case Study Thumbnails: Your case study thumbnails will link your user to the different projects you worked on. This part is even more important than your landing page because it showcases your skills and talent. Case study thumbnails should be enticing and work both individually and together. The background should harmonize, and the same device mockup style should be used for each thumbnail.

3.  UX Case Studies: Probably the most important aspect of your portfolio, you should display UX case studies prominently on your portfolio. These case studies should include your logical thought processes throughout the project, and any soft/hard skills you gained/used on the project. Additionally, you should talk about your design process, and how you incorporated UX design methods as part of this process. Finally, you should express openness to feedback and a desire to improve on each study.
