<p>Authentic: In relation to the UI, authentic means that the website reflects the true spirit of skateboarding. It should be free-spirited, rebellious, and individualistic. Skateboarders can tell when someone is a “poser”, or only does something to try and gain validation. If my user feels that the interface is trying too hard to gain their validation, it will turn them off from the overall website.</p>
<p>Expression: I want my UI to give skateboarders the freedom to express themselves through their skateboard design. Skateboarders like to express themselves through their clothes, tricks, music, and skateboards. If they feel like my UI doesn’t give them the ability to fully express their ideas, it will dissuade them from my website.</p>
<p>How will I express these values in my UI:</p>
<p>Authentic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Aesthetic: I will use some of the raw, gritty elements of skateboarding and skateboarding culture. This includes the bright, yet rough colors of graffiti and skateparks. At the same time, I want it to have a sleek feel associated with the video games these skateboarders grew up on.</li>
<li>Tone: I want my website to have a direct casual tone. I might choose to incorporate some of the slang used by skateboarders. This will help the UI feel more authentic and relatable, while not looking like it’s trying too hard.</li>
<li>User-generated content: I want to include some form of user-generated content on the site. For example, this could be videos/pictures of users receiving/using their boards or gear, or custom designed decks. I think this would help promote a sense of community and help add to the authenticity of the site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expression:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customization Options: I will include tools that allow users to design their own skateboard, choosing colors, graphics, and personal details. This feature will empower users to express their personal style through the website.</li>
<li>Bold, Dynamic, Color Pallette: The UI will have loud, vibrant, high-contrast colors that reflect the energy of skateboarding. By allowing users to interact with bold elements, it will help them feel more comfortable in expressing their own creative interests.</li>
<li>Interactive Features: Users will have the ability to submit their own designs for decks and wheels through design competitions. This will promote a sense of expression and community on the website, while also making the user feel like their voice matters in the community.</li>

<p>Statue of Liberty (1983) - Robert Rauschenberg</p>
<p>This piece, entitled simply &quot;Statue of Liberty&quot;, was created in 1983 by Robert Rauschenberg. Rauschenberg stated that he liked to mix different elements in his paintings, and wanted his work to fall somewhere in between the gap of art and real life. In the painting, Rauschenberg layers elements of American identity, particularly the Statue of Liberty. This is most likely inspired by the fact that he lived most of his life in New York City. He created this work using lithography, where a design is etched on to stone and then pressed against a paper to transfer it.</p>
<p>&quot;Layout&quot;</p>
<p>The first thing that struck me about this painting was the layout. Immediately I was drawn to the close-up sweeping green texture of the Statue of Liberty&#x27;s dress in the upper left hand corner. On the bottom-left, a dark black structural texture flows up to the right. Both these elements guide your eyes to the middle bottom-right of the piece which features a blueprint-esque overlay of the Statue of Liberty. This helps create a sense of depth and direction with the artwork that makes it really interesting to look at. Upon doing further research, I&#x27;ve discovered that artists use strong lines like this to help the reader focus on certain aspects of their composition. Strong diagonal lines indicate a faster directional movement, whereas thinner horizonal lines create a sense stability.</p>

<p>&quot;Color Harmony&quot;</p>
<p>Another thing that stuck out to me about this painting was how well the colors work together. The gritty browns and greens of the background are reminiscent of the traditional colors of the military. This may be Rauschenberg&#x27;s attempt to display the character of the traditional American spirit, considering he was drafted into the military at one point. In contrast to this, strong white lines are overlayed displaying the Statue of Liberty, and above that some differing textures. I think this works well with the other colors, well still popping against the background, creating a sense of depth. After looking into this topic more, I found one quote that really stuck with me as it relates to color harmony. On Jeffrey Hayes&#x27;s blog, when describing color harmony, he states &quot;But in the end, the gut reaction that happens in the first few seconds is always right.&quot; My gut reaction to this painting&#x27;s colors consists of feelings of grit, perseverance, ingenuity, and pride.</p>

<p>&quot;Contrast&quot;</p>
<p>The final thing I noted about this painting was the contrast it provided. Aside from the contrast of color, the painting incorporates numerous textures to convey its meaning. The top-left dress of the Statue of Liberty flows while still having these sharp rocky images. Similarly, the black structural texture has these rough edges that fight against the lower-left green paint it moves into. Additionally, at the top-right of the painting, a postcard of the Statue of Liberty can be seen which contrasts from everything else entirely. This creates a sense of personalness in the piece, almost as if that&#x27;s a personal postcard Rauschenberg either sent or received. In a blog post from etchrLAB, the author states &quot;contrast can be used to tell a story, to create a better composition, to create a sense of unease, to create a sense of peace.&quot; I think Rauschenberg accomplishes all of these with his use of contrasting colors, textures, and mediums.</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="UI Sketch" src="/zach-ui-portfolio/assets/images/IMG_0069-e93f8a634691b260d4251f15cf08378a.jpg" width="1690" height="1309" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>As a result of this painting, I chose to create a UI sketch for a new U.S. Army homepage. I imagined a gritty design featuring dirt textures, camo, a realistic (possibly torn) American flag, a realistic Statue of Liberty, and phrases like &quot;Over 400,000 Strong.&quot; I really wanted to convey the fight and drive associated with the U.S. Army. I took inspiration from the color scheme of the original painting, and from the white designs overlayed. Ideally, I would overlay words like &quot;GRIT&quot; and &quot;PRIDE&quot; on the landing page to invoke a sense of patriotism in the potential applicant. The lines of the navbar and other elements would also be jagged, further emphasizing these ideals.</p>
<p>Overall, I learned a lot about different design techniques as a result of this exercise. From layout, to color harmony, to contrast, I&#x27;ve learned how these ideas are important for creating a cohesive piece which conveys a message. I then took these ideas and implemented them into a rudimentary sketch that tries to conveys a similar meaning using different design techniques.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zach-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/freeform">FreeForm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/zach-ui-portfolio/blog/ColorStudy">Color Study</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-09-27T14:30:00.000Z">September 27, 2024</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>For this exercise, I took a look at the Hulu app. Hulu is a video streaming platform with a constantly updating catalog of new shows, movies, and news broadcasts. I created a simple mockup of the app in Figma, and then experimented with three alternative colorways to analyze what different emotions and feelings the app gives off.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Green Hulu" src="/zach-ui-portfolio/assets/images/GreenHulu-c57d270e73150d3218d7dae5e1f0e39a.png" width="430" height="932" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The first user interface here shows the original Hulu screen with it&#x27;s bright green logo and dark green/teal background. This is a fairly analogous color scheme with all the colors falling pretty close to each other on the color wheel. When designing this interface, I believe the designers wanted to give the user a sense of calmness as they sat down to watch their favorite movie or tv show. At the same time, the green palate gives off a sense of freshness as new shows continue to populate the app each week. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a very pleasing design, and does a good job of balancing feelings of excitement with feelings of tranquility.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Orange Hulu" src="/zach-ui-portfolio/assets/images/OrangeHulu-2fd8ca9e3d5618d6dcec249668fdc2d6.png" width="430" height="932" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The second interface here is the first redesign I did and shows a bright orange Hulu logo overlayed on top of a burnt orange/brown backdrop. This, as with the following two examples, also follows an analogous color scheme as I wanted to keep the general idea Hulu was going for, while still experimenting with different colors. Overall I have mixed feelings about this color scheme. On one hand, I don&#x27;t mind the brown background, and I think it also helps establish a sense of calmness in the user. On the other hand, the brown seems too safe for a tech and entertainment company who is constantly releasing new features and shows. I think if the shows were more geared towards relaxing content this wouldn&#x27;t be a bad color scheme, but with the variety of shows Hulu has, I just don&#x27;t think it works well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Red Hulu" src="/zach-ui-portfolio/assets/images/RedHulu-c188c36fd2201877b9f01112ebd2e0f0.png" width="430" height="932" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>My second redesign shows a bright red Hulu logo on top of a maroon/burgundy background. This is one design that I actually really like. I think the red gives a sense of warmth, guiding the user to cozy up for a night of entertainment. At the same time, it has a sense of passion or desire behind it that&#x27;s perfect for couples looking to watch a movie for their date night. I also feel like the red is dulled enough so as to not spur any feelings of aggression or fear in the user. The only problem I could see with this color scheme is it has striking similarities to one of Hulu&#x27;s main competitors, Netflix, and by using the same color scheme, it would be a bit harder for Hulu to differentiate themself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Blue Hulu" src="/zach-ui-portfolio/assets/images/BlueHulu-446162ef96939fb4a5c99978afbc8fa7.png" width="430" height="932" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The last redesign here shows an electric blue Hulu logo complemented by a dark blue background. This is my favorite color scheme out of all the redesigns. The electric blue logo conveys the feeling that Hulu is cutting edge and constantly evolving, which is perfect for a tech company. At the same time, as the user gets further down into the page, they are greeted with this dark blue gradient that&#x27;s almost akin to diving deeper into unknown waters. It&#x27;s elicits a sense of mystery and intrigue, while still feeling calming and tranquil. Overall, I really enjoy this color scheme, and if Hulu one day decided to change their app to these colors, I&#x27;d have no problem with it.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think Hulu&#x27;s designers did a very good job choosing the color scheme for their application. It conveys calmness while still feeling fresh. However, I think the most effective design would have to be the blue colorway. When a user is scrolling through an entertainment app like Hulu, they are either staying on the surface and watching a familiar favorite, or they venture down to explore what else the app has to offer. I think the blue colorway is a perfect visual representation of this journey. At the same time, the electric blue logo conveys that the app, and company are forever evolving and on the cutting edge of the latest technology.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zach-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/freeform">FreeForm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/zach-ui-portfolio/blog/Colors1">Colors I</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-09-24T14:30:00.000Z">September 24, 2024</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that I found interesting in this section was when the book talked about after-images. It described how when you look at a color for a long time, the cones in your eyes can get tired and then when you look at a white wall, you will see the complementary color. It then described that this was the reason operating rooms were green and doctors wore green scrubs, because they are so focused on red in an operating room, that the green provides a sense of relief for their eyes. Whenever I&#x27;ve gone off to design my room, a poster, or a website, I&#x27;ve always had the idea in mind that all the colors should mix well together. For example, in designing my room, I&#x27;ll typically stick with colors that are usually all cool or all warm, but rarely mix the two. This information, however, has made me rethink my ideas. After doing some more research, I found an article that describes how powerful complementary colors can be in interior design. It states that you should aim to have a color scheme that is roughly 75%-85% either warm or cool, and then mix in opposing elements to provide a sense of relief. After reading these two sections, it seems I have some redecorating to do.</p>

Notes from 2-3 interviews with potential users of your UI. What pain points do they have given their current workflows? Why do they engage in those workflows? What is the desired outcome of the workflow?</p>
<p>One pain point users had was not knowing what board size was right for them
Another pain point users had was not having enough control over the design of the wooden board, as websites only allowed predesigned options
Users noted that they had trouble knowing which components were compatible with their in-progress skateboard build
The last main pain point came from users being sometimes overwhelmed with the all the different options on the screen at the first time
Users engaged in these workflows with the goal that they could acquire a new skateboard, or skateboard parts
Users engaged in these workflows because they had more options than going to a store in person
The desired outcome of this workflow is that the user has an easy, yet fulfilling process designing and ordering their skateboard</p>
<p>Shape your story&#x27;s character as a truthful composite of your interviewees:
Who is the character? Name, background, current occupation, time in the occupation, awareness of tech, etc. (only info that&#x27;s relevant to your task)</p>
<p>Name: Ben Roter</p>
<p>Background: Ben is a 21-year-old skateboard enthusiast who started skating as a teen. He’s built some skateboards in the past, either in skate shops or online, but is always looking to improve his setup. He currently works as part of a digital marketing agency, designing graphics and creating campaigns. As a result, he has some experience with graphic design, and works on his own art in his free time. He has experience working with a host of different design and web technologies. He has worked as a digital marketer for the past 2 years, and has a keen eye for detail.</p>
<p>What are their responsibilities, values, and/or personal goals?</p>
<p>Coming from a design background, Ben holds creativity in high esteem. He keeps note of things he finds interesting or unique. He likes to stay up to date with the current technologies and design trends coming out. As a marketer, Ben values efficiency. Part of his job is getting things done in the best way possible, and he appreciates when others value that. He’s very good at managing multiple different tasks at the same time, and frequently interacts with a diverse range of people. He hopes to create a skateboard that he can ride to work in the mornings, or can practice on at the local skatepark. He wants his board to be unique to him, and express his creativity and personal style. Additionally, he hopes that he can create the board without having to learn another design tool.
Story brainstorming:
The ultimate goal: Why do users need to interact with your UI?</p>
<p>Users need to interact with my UI in order to create a custom skateboard. They will have the ability to easily choose certain colors, designs, etc. which will give them a truly unique and rewarding experience for creating their board.</p>
<p>Brainstorm 15 possible scenarios (remember, quantity and novelty are more important than feasibility). Include all 15 in your document. (You could include a snapshot of a notebook, post-its, etc., since you&#x27;ll be brainstorming by hand!)</p>
<p>Color Mixer - User is able to interact with a custom color mixer tool that will allow them to have solid colors or gradients on their deck
Design Tool - Users will be able to draw, create shapes, write text, make lines, etc. on their board which allows them to create a custom design
AR Visualizer - Users will have the ability to see what their design would look like in real life using an AR Visualizer tool
Community Designs - Users will have the ability to submit/copy designs to/from a community showcase that can be seen by all users on the platform
Budget Tool - Users will have access to a budget tool allowing them to create budget friendly designs and compare the prices of different items
Compatibility Tool - As users select different products for their custom board, the UI will update letting users know what other products are compatible with their current build. Users can also compare two items to see if they are compatible.
Design Guide - Users will have the option to follow a step-by-step design guide that will take them through the process of creating their first board. Almost like a tutorial.
Photo Upload - Users will have the option to upload personal photos that can be placed on their board.
3D Model - As users design their board, they will have a 3D Model preview of their board that updates in real time.
Favorite Builds - Users will have the capability to favorite boards and board designs so that they can use them in the future.
Customizable Deck Shapes - Users will have the ability to create custom deck shapes based on their needs.
Deck Sizing Guide - Users will have access to a deck sizing guide that allows them to input their height and weight and receive deck size recommendations.
Matching Clothing Bundle - Users will have the ability to transfer their design to select clothing items and receive a bundle that includes the clothing and their deck.
Design Contests - Users can participate in design contests and win rewards. The best designs will be featured in a showcase and be able to be used by other users.
Collaborative Design - Users will be able to collaborate in real time with others who they invite to a session.</p>
<p>Pick your most compelling story.</p>
<p>Design Tool - Users will be able to draw, create shapes, write text, make lines, etc. on their board which allows them to create a custom design</p>
<p>Imagine some details. Outline them in your document.
Where is the user when they are interacting with their UI? Are there any constraints in this space that need to be noted? (Is the space small? Is the character in front of customers, investors, or children? Is the room dark? etc.) Why might the space be relevant for users of your interface?</p>
<p>As an e-commerce/design site, users are most likely to be at their place of residence while interacting with the UI. The most common constraint for at-home customers would be other distractions that cause them to step away from the UI. For this reason, it’s important that designs are automatically saved. We can assume users will have access to a stable network connection. Consumers are most likely to be in a variety of lighting situations depending on their home.</p>
<p>When is the user interacting with your UI? Is the character in a hurry? Are they hungry? Are they getting ready for bed? Why is the timing relevant to a user interacting with your interface?</p>
<p>The user is most likely interacting with our UI when they have some free time. They are most likely not in a rush, or in need of anything quickly. For this reason, I suspect users will most likely use the product in the evening, at night, or on the weekends. I suspect that if the user is trying to make a custom design, they would want to take their time. This is important because we want to still give the user a relatively quick process, but it’s not necessarily the most important thing.</p>
<p>Now, it&#x27;s time to introduce a plot.
How is the user going to interact with your UI? How are they going to access your UI?</p>
<p>The user will interact with our UI using a web interface. If I choose to include it in AR mode, it means that a mobile feature will most likely need to be added to accommodate this. They will access our UI either through a marketing link/ad, or through an organic Google search. Before having full access to all UI features, they will first need to create an account on the site.</p>
<p>How do they navigate through the UI (You may not have all of these details yet, so you can keep it general.)?</p>
<p>The user will first navigate through a simple UI prompting them to create an account. Users will be allowed to check out as a guest, but will not have access to creating custom designs without an account. From there, users will either have access to prebuilt boards, the custom design tool, build your own board, or individual components. Prebuilt boards and individual components will be similar to traditional e-commerce websites. The custom design tool will have a similar layout to Adobe Illustrator, and allow users to customize their own board. The build your own board page will take users through a step-by-step process of choosing all the components they need for a custom board. In this process, users will have a 3D render of the board as they choose to build it.</p>
<p>What are they thinking as they interact with it?</p>
<p>More than anything, the user is most likely thinking of whatever design idea they have in mind for their board. This might not be concrete yet, but it’s important that the UI allows for simple tasks to be as easy as possible, while still helping the user achieve this vision.</p>
<p>How will they know they&#x27;ve been successful in completing their tasks? Answer these questions and any others that are relevant in your design doc.</p>
<p>Users will know they’ve been successful in creating a custom design as it will save the design to their account. When building their own board, users will see components be replaced on a 3D render and also listed somewhere. They will know they are done building a board when the interface prompts them to add their skateboard to the cart. For simple tasks, notification banners will let users know whether their actions were successful.</p>
<p>Bring it all together: Write a story (~300-600 words) incorporating all the details you outlined above. Be effortful and intentional when writing your story. This story will motivate everything you do for this project henceforth. The pages you design will be those motivated by this story. The task you provide your user test participants will be the task motivated by this story. This story will appear verbatim (with some possible editing) in your final project narrative on your portfolio. This story is the foundation for your project, so make sure it is stable (or at least approaching stability).</p>
<p>User Story: Ben’s Custom Board</p>
<p>Ben Roter is a 21-year-old skateboard enthusiast with a background in digital marketing and design. After breaking his old board at the skate park last weekend, Ben is looking to build a new skateboard that reflects his personality and creative flare. His friend recommended he try a new website that allows users to customize their own skateboard decks. After a long day of work, Ben settles onto his couch and opens his laptop, excited to try this new website. Ben is looking to design a skateboard that he can ride to work in the mornings, but also at the skatepark when he has time.</p>
<p>Ben’s home is well-lit, with quick internet speeds. He occasionally has to get up during his web session to do various chores, or answer calls from family and friends. Upon opening the website, Ben is greeted with a well-designed page prompting him to either sign in, create an account, or continue as a guest. Since he’s not sure whether he needs an account, Ben decides to continue as a guest. From there, Ben is taken to a stunning homepage featuring popular user designs, different skate parts, and a comprehensive navigation bar. In the navigation bar, Ben sees labels for: “Skateboard Parts”, “Pre Built Skateboards”, “Design Your Own Deck”, “Build a Custom Skateboard”, and “Community Designs”. Ben is intrigued by the “Design Your Own Deck” option, and hovers over the text, revealing a dropdown navigation with more options under each main navigation item. Still interested in designing his own deck, Ben clicks on the navigation item. He is taken to a page with a grayed out background and a notification prompting him that he must create an account to design his own deck with a small button to sign in or create an account. Ben then clicks the button and signs up using his personal email.</p>
<p>After navigating back to the page, Ben sees that there is a blank skateboard in the center with tools on the top and side containing different icons. Being in a design field, Ben recognizes most of the icons as allowing him to draw on the board, add shapes, or change the background color. For the icons he doesn’t know, Ben hovers over them and is prompted with a description of what the tool does. Ben spends some time designing a board, and when he’s done, he saves it to his account. After saving to his account, he gets a call and closes the site, returning about 30 minutes later.</p>
<p>When Ben returns to the site, he navigates over to the “Build a Custom Skateboard” tab. He is then taken to a page where he can select a deck for his skateboard. There is a tab for the normal designs, and one for custom user designs. Ben selects his design and hits continue. After he hits this button, a 3D render appears with his deck design on it. Additionally, a progress bar appears at the top of the screen. Ben goes through, selecting the proper wheels, bearings, and trucks for his deck. When a type of component is not compatible with his current build, it is given a faint red overlay. Eventually, Ben finishes designing his skateboard, and chooses “Add to Cart”. From there, he follows a standard checkout interface, and after placing the order is sent a tracking number and a receipt for his purchase.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zach-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/freeform">FreeForm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/zach-ui-portfolio/blog/AffordancesSignifiers2">Affordances &amp; Signifiers II</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-09-03T14:30:00.000Z">September 3, 2024</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>One concept that really stood out to me in this chapter was the idea of positive psychology as it relates to user experience and design. The book takes a different approach from what I&#x27;ve been typically taught in school and encourages designers to push themselves outside the box and fail. Only by failing can designers learn from their mistakes. In contrast, I believe the traditional education system promotes the idea that students should stick to what they know and play it safe so they can receive a good grade. Furthermore, the book advises that designers should think positively for themselves and the people they interact with. I really enjoy this line of thinking as I think students and designers can get bogged down by the rules, budgeting, and logistics that come with creating a project which can lead to negative thought patterns. Instead, the book seems to argue for more of a &quot;expect the best, plan for the worst&quot; approach where designers should think positively about their users, but be forgiving of their mistakes. After all, as much as a designer wouldn&#x27;t want to be punished for a design failure, a user wouldn&#x27;t want to be punished for their mistake in using the design. The image I attached shows a form that instead of deleting the users data, saves it and gives them suggestions on how to correctly complete the form.</p>
