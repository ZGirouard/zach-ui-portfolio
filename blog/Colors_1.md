# Example Blog Post

One thing that I found interesting in this section was when the book talked about after-images. It described how when you look at a color for a long time, the cones in your eyes can get tired and then when you look at a white wall, you will see the complementary color. It then described that this was the reason operating rooms were green and doctors wore green scrubs, because they are so focused on red in an operating room, that the green provides a sense of relief for their eyes. Whenever I've gone off to design my room, a poster, or a website, I've always had the idea in mind that all the colors should mix well together. For example, in designing my room, I'll typically stick with colors that are usually all cool or all warm, but rarely mix the two. This information, however, has made me rethink my ideas. After doing some more research, I found an article that describes how powerful complementary colors can be in interior design. It states that you should aim to have a color scheme that is roughly 75%-85% either warm or cool, and then mix in opposing elements to provide a sense of relief. After reading these two sections, it seems I have some redecorating to do.
