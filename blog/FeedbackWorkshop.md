Word: Empathetic



When it comes to delivering or receiving design feedback, I think being empathetic is a vital skill. On the receiving end of feedback, it's very easy to get defensive about your design. After all, most designers pour hours upon hours of hard work into their projects. However, it's important to recognize that your subjective view isn't always what's most important. Just because a design is straightforward and aesthetic to you doesn't mean it is to your users. And if your users can't use your design, than what's the point. On the other hand, when giving others feedback, its important to be empathetic of their situation. Don't criticize them as a designer or user unnecessarily harmful language. Instead, politely express your viewpoints while also opening up the critique for discussion. This will often make the critiqued designer feel less defensive, and will help lead to more creative solutions. While it may seem obvious, I think its important that we remember to empathize with those working with  us and with those who will use our designs. Only then can we grow as designers and create the best possible solutions for everyone.
