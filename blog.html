It described how when you look at a color for a long time, the cones in your eyes can get tired and then when you look at a white wall, you will see the complementary color. It then described that this was the reason operating rooms were green and doctors wore green scrubs, because they are so focused on red in an operating room, that the green provides a sense of relief for their eyes. Whenever I've gone off to design my room, a poster, or a website, I've always had the idea in mind that all the colors should mix well together. For example, in designing my room, I'll typically stick with colors that are usually all cool or all warm, but rarely mix the two. This information, however, has made me rethink my ideas. After doing some more research, I found an article that describes how powerful complementary colors can be in interior design. It states that you should aim to have a color scheme that is roughly 75%-85% either warm or cool, and then mix in opposing elements to provide a sense of relief. After reading these two sections, it seems I have some redecorating to do.","datePublished":"2024-09-24T14:30:00.000Z","author":[],"keywords":[]}]}</script><link rel="alternate" type="application/rss+xml" href="/zach-ui-portfolio/blog/rss.xml" title="Zachary Girouard RSS Feed">

<ol>
<li>
<p>Homepage: Create a visually stunning homepage that fits the theme of your brand/projects. This could be through neon colors, a pastel color palette, interesting typography, etc. On the homepage, include your name, occupation, designer statement, links/thumbnails to case studies. and navigation. Make it easy for your user to see more of your portfolio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Case Study Thumbnails: Your case study thumbnails will link your user to the different projects you worked on. This part is even more important than your landing page because it showcases your skills and talent. Case study thumbnails should be enticing and work both individually and together. The background should harmonize, and the same device mockup style should be used for each thumbnail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UX Case Studies: Probably the most important aspect of your portfolio, you should display UX case studies prominently on your portfolio. These case studies should include your logical thought processes throughout the project, and any soft/hard skills you gained/used on the project. Additionally, you should talk about your design process, and how you incorporated UX design methods as part of this process. Finally, you should express openness to feedback and a desire to improve on each study.</p>

<p>Authentic: In relation to the UI, authentic means that the website reflects the true spirit of skateboarding. It should be free-spirited, rebellious, and individualistic. Skateboarders can tell when someone is a “poser”, or only does something to try and gain validation. If my user feels that the interface is trying too hard to gain their validation, it will turn them off from the overall website.</p>
<p>Expression: I want my UI to give skateboarders the freedom to express themselves through their skateboard design. Skateboarders like to express themselves through their clothes, tricks, music, and skateboards. If they feel like my UI doesn’t give them the ability to fully express their ideas, it will dissuade them from my website.</p>
<p>How will I express these values in my UI:</p>
<p>Authentic:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Aesthetic: I will use some of the raw, gritty elements of skateboarding and skateboarding culture. This includes the bright, yet rough colors of graffiti and skateparks. At the same time, I want it to have a sleek feel associated with the video games these skateboarders grew up on.</li>
<li>Tone: I want my website to have a direct casual tone. I might choose to incorporate some of the slang used by skateboarders. This will help the UI feel more authentic and relatable, while not looking like it’s trying too hard.</li>
<li>User-generated content: I want to include some form of user-generated content on the site. For example, this could be videos/pictures of users receiving/using their boards or gear, or custom designed decks. I think this would help promote a sense of community and help add to the authenticity of the site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expression:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customization Options: I will include tools that allow users to design their own skateboard, choosing colors, graphics, and personal details. This feature will empower users to express their personal style through the website.</li>
<li>Bold, Dynamic, Color Pallette: The UI will have loud, vibrant, high-contrast colors that reflect the energy of skateboarding. By allowing users to interact with bold elements, it will help them feel more comfortable in expressing their own creative interests.</li>
<li>Interactive Features: Users will have the ability to submit their own designs for decks and wheels through design competitions. This will promote a sense of expression and community on the website, while also making the user feel like their voice matters in the community.</li>

While there are endless nuances to each of these steps, I thought these were some of the most important points.</p>
<p>Tutorial: How to create effective navigation on a website:</p>
<p>Step 1: Create a home link - Typically, this link will take the form a logo or specific typeface and reside on the top of the page. Users will then be able to use this link to navigate back to the homepage. It is common knowledge that these special designs should be links, so including the words &quot;home&quot; next to it is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Step 2: Design a navigation menu - Have the most broad categories on the first level of the navigation menu, followed by secondary categories underneath each main one. When a user is on a certain page in the navigation menu, the corresponding text/block in the navigation menu should change to emphasize this.</p>
<p>Step 3: Include a breadcrumb trail - A breadcrumb trail is useful for letting the user know where they are in the website. This should be done by including all the relevant pages the user took to get to where they are separated by a greater than &quot;&gt;&quot; sign. The current/final item in the breadcrumb menu should be bolded to show the user where they are.</p>
<p>Step 4: Include a search feature - Somewhere near your navigation bar, include an input box with the word &quot;search&quot; somewhere near it, and a button. If the button doesn&#x27;t contain the word search, include an appropriate word like &quot;go&quot; in the button. Search features should be easily understood, and should encompass the entire website unless otherwise specified. For example, if the user is only able to search for authors on the website, include &quot;Search for author&quot; near the box so as not to cause confusion.</p>

<p>Statue of Liberty (1983) - Robert Rauschenberg</p>
<p>This piece, entitled simply &quot;Statue of Liberty&quot;, was created in 1983 by Robert Rauschenberg. Rauschenberg stated that he liked to mix different elements in his paintings, and wanted his work to fall somewhere in between the gap of art and real life. In the painting, Rauschenberg layers elements of American identity, particularly the Statue of Liberty. This is most likely inspired by the fact that he lived most of his life in New York City. He created this work using lithography, where a design is etched on to stone and then pressed against a paper to transfer it.</p>
<p>&quot;Layout&quot;</p>
<p>The first thing that struck me about this painting was the layout. Immediately I was drawn to the close-up sweeping green texture of the Statue of Liberty&#x27;s dress in the upper left hand corner. On the bottom-left, a dark black structural texture flows up to the right. Both these elements guide your eyes to the middle bottom-right of the piece which features a blueprint-esque overlay of the Statue of Liberty. This helps create a sense of depth and direction with the artwork that makes it really interesting to look at. Upon doing further research, I&#x27;ve discovered that artists use strong lines like this to help the reader focus on certain aspects of their composition. Strong diagonal lines indicate a faster directional movement, whereas thinner horizonal lines create a sense stability.</p>

<p>&quot;Color Harmony&quot;</p>
<p>Another thing that stuck out to me about this painting was how well the colors work together. The gritty browns and greens of the background are reminiscent of the traditional colors of the military. This may be Rauschenberg&#x27;s attempt to display the character of the traditional American spirit, considering he was drafted into the military at one point. In contrast to this, strong white lines are overlayed displaying the Statue of Liberty, and above that some differing textures. I think this works well with the other colors, well still popping against the background, creating a sense of depth. After looking into this topic more, I found one quote that really stuck with me as it relates to color harmony. On Jeffrey Hayes&#x27;s blog, when describing color harmony, he states &quot;But in the end, the gut reaction that happens in the first few seconds is always right.&quot; My gut reaction to this painting&#x27;s colors consists of feelings of grit, perseverance, ingenuity, and pride.</p>

<p>&quot;Contrast&quot;</p>
<p>The final thing I noted about this painting was the contrast it provided. Aside from the contrast of color, the painting incorporates numerous textures to convey its meaning. The top-left dress of the Statue of Liberty flows while still having these sharp rocky images. Similarly, the black structural texture has these rough edges that fight against the lower-left green paint it moves into. Additionally, at the top-right of the painting, a postcard of the Statue of Liberty can be seen which contrasts from everything else entirely. This creates a sense of personalness in the piece, almost as if that&#x27;s a personal postcard Rauschenberg either sent or received. In a blog post from etchrLAB, the author states &quot;contrast can be used to tell a story, to create a better composition, to create a sense of unease, to create a sense of peace.&quot; I think Rauschenberg accomplishes all of these with his use of contrasting colors, textures, and mediums.</p>

<p>As a result of this painting, I chose to create a UI sketch for a new U.S. Army homepage. I imagined a gritty design featuring dirt textures, camo, a realistic (possibly torn) American flag, a realistic Statue of Liberty, and phrases like &quot;Over 400,000 Strong.&quot; I really wanted to convey the fight and drive associated with the U.S. Army. I took inspiration from the color scheme of the original painting, and from the white designs overlayed. Ideally, I would overlay words like &quot;GRIT&quot; and &quot;PRIDE&quot; on the landing page to invoke a sense of patriotism in the potential applicant. The lines of the navbar and other elements would also be jagged, further emphasizing these ideals.</p>
<p>Overall, I learned a lot about different design techniques as a result of this exercise. From layout, to color harmony, to contrast, I&#x27;ve learned how these ideas are important for creating a cohesive piece which conveys a message. I then took these ideas and implemented them into a rudimentary sketch that tries to conveys a similar meaning using different design techniques.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zach-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/freeform">FreeForm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/zach-ui-portfolio/blog/DesignSystems">Design Systems</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-10-02T14:30:00.000Z">October 2, 2024</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Style-guides are to designers as textbooks are to students&quot;</p>
<p>After reading these articles, I kept noticing how the Figma team mentioned keeping a centralized style-guide or set of rules for your product. These rules encompassed areas of typography, accessibility, localization, and many more, and they gave the designer the guidelines for keeping designs consistent and effective. I think this is very similar to how students use textbooks. When they first read a textbook, they get familiarized with the pre-established rules and strategies of their field of study. Then, as they venture off into their own projects, it&#x27;s common for them to go back and reference these textbooks so they ensure they are following the rules properly. Both style-guides and textbooks help to enforce certain rules and empower the reader to better accomplish their tasks. As part of my current internship, I&#x27;ve already had to reference UNL&#x27;s style-guide and their custom framework so I can ensure all UNL websites follow the same rules. In future careers, I don&#x27;t doubt that I&#x27;ll encounter new style-guides which I&#x27;ll then use to help a company portray their brand properly. If I&#x27;m lucky, I might even get to contribute to one of these style-guides!</p>

I created a simple mockup of the app in Figma, and then experimented with three alternative colorways to analyze what different emotions and feelings the app gives off.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Green Hulu" src="/zach-ui-portfolio/assets/images/GreenHulu-c57d270e73150d3218d7dae5e1f0e39a.png" width="430" height="932" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The first user interface here shows the original Hulu screen with it&#x27;s bright green logo and dark green/teal background. This is a fairly analogous color scheme with all the colors falling pretty close to each other on the color wheel. When designing this interface, I believe the designers wanted to give the user a sense of calmness as they sat down to watch their favorite movie or tv show. At the same time, the green palate gives off a sense of freshness as new shows continue to populate the app each week. Overall, I think it&#x27;s a very pleasing design, and does a good job of balancing feelings of excitement with feelings of tranquility.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Orange Hulu" src="/zach-ui-portfolio/assets/images/OrangeHulu-2fd8ca9e3d5618d6dcec249668fdc2d6.png" width="430" height="932" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The second interface here is the first redesign I did and shows a bright orange Hulu logo overlayed on top of a burnt orange/brown backdrop. This, as with the following two examples, also follows an analogous color scheme as I wanted to keep the general idea Hulu was going for, while still experimenting with different colors. Overall I have mixed feelings about this color scheme. On one hand, I don&#x27;t mind the brown background, and I think it also helps establish a sense of calmness in the user. On the other hand, the brown seems too safe for a tech and entertainment company who is constantly releasing new features and shows. I think if the shows were more geared towards relaxing content this wouldn&#x27;t be a bad color scheme, but with the variety of shows Hulu has, I just don&#x27;t think it works well.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Red Hulu" src="/zach-ui-portfolio/assets/images/RedHulu-c188c36fd2201877b9f01112ebd2e0f0.png" width="430" height="932" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>My second redesign shows a bright red Hulu logo on top of a maroon/burgundy background. This is one design that I actually really like. I think the red gives a sense of warmth, guiding the user to cozy up for a night of entertainment. At the same time, it has a sense of passion or desire behind it that&#x27;s perfect for couples looking to watch a movie for their date night. I also feel like the red is dulled enough so as to not spur any feelings of aggression or fear in the user. The only problem I could see with this color scheme is it has striking similarities to one of Hulu&#x27;s main competitors, Netflix, and by using the same color scheme, it would be a bit harder for Hulu to differentiate themself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Blue Hulu" src="/zach-ui-portfolio/assets/images/BlueHulu-446162ef96939fb4a5c99978afbc8fa7.png" width="430" height="932" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The last redesign here shows an electric blue Hulu logo complemented by a dark blue background. This is my favorite color scheme out of all the redesigns. The electric blue logo conveys the feeling that Hulu is cutting edge and constantly evolving, which is perfect for a tech company. At the same time, as the user gets further down into the page, they are greeted with this dark blue gradient that&#x27;s almost akin to diving deeper into unknown waters. It&#x27;s elicits a sense of mystery and intrigue, while still feeling calming and tranquil. Overall, I really enjoy this color scheme, and if Hulu one day decided to change their app to these colors, I&#x27;d have no problem with it.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think Hulu&#x27;s designers did a very good job choosing the color scheme for their application. It conveys calmness while still feeling fresh. However, I think the most effective design would have to be the blue colorway. When a user is scrolling through an entertainment app like Hulu, they are either staying on the surface and watching a familiar favorite, or they venture down to explore what else the app has to offer. I think the blue colorway is a perfect visual representation of this journey. At the same time, the electric blue logo conveys that the app, and company are forever evolving and on the cutting edge of the latest technology.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a title="Share something that captured you from the reading in any format, citing your sources." class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/zach-ui-portfolio/blog/tags/freeform">FreeForm</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/zach-ui-portfolio/blog/Colors1">Colors I</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2024-09-24T14:30:00.000Z">September 24, 2024</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div></header><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that I found interesting in this section was when the book talked about after-images. It described how when you look at a color for a long time, the cones in your eyes can get tired and then when you look at a white wall, you will see the complementary color. It then described that this was the reason operating rooms were green and doctors wore green scrubs, because they are so focused on red in an operating room, that the green provides a sense of relief for their eyes. Whenever I&#x27;ve gone off to design my room, a poster, or a website, I&#x27;ve always had the idea in mind that all the colors should mix well together. For example, in designing my room, I&#x27;ll typically stick with colors that are usually all cool or all warm, but rarely mix the two. This information, however, has made me rethink my ideas. After doing some more research, I found an article that describes how powerful complementary colors can be in interior design. It states that you should aim to have a color scheme that is roughly 75%-85% either warm or cool, and then mix in opposing elements to provide a sense of relief. After reading these two sections, it seems I have some redecorating to do.</p>
